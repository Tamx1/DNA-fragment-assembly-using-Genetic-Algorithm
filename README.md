# Solve DNA fragment assembly problem using Genetic Algorithm
The importance and difficulty of the project DNA fragment assembly problem has been increasing that a fast and accurate assembly is a major part of DNA sequencing projects, the Deoxyribonucleic acid or called “DNA” is an atom made out of two polynucleotide chains that curl around one another to frame a twofold helix carrying genetic instructions, many different algorithms have been built to solve it but not all of the algorithms have a good effect an excellent or good solution close to the exact solution for that we want to select and to choose the perfect algorithm for this hard DNA fragment assembly problem and what can we improve that using crossovers, mutations and many things that we will be covering in this project, an exact solutions cannot be obtained easily Because of the difficulty and complexity of this problem and since this problem is NP-hard. This project aims to give a very comprehensive study, Experiments and analyzes of complex solutions, extracted from the Genetic algorithm, several different crossovers, and several different mutations and stopping conditions for the DNA fragment assembly problem , providing a good read for the biologists and practitioners in that field, we will review the Genetic algorithm, crossovers and mutations in our solutions later on, and we will show the data sets used, and the tests for the Genetic algorithm. We will discuss a very comprehensive and many teststhat we done using genetic algorithm and comprehensive compare between the crossovers and mutations and stop conations that has been used in this DNA fragment assembly problem project.
